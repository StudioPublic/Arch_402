    <p>Architecture has long been associated with drawing. In the last thirty years, these drawings have been
        increasingly connected to digital information stored in files. Files store the data used to generate images on a
        screen, distribute 3D models, or send information to a machine for fabrication. Architects and historians have
        dedicated significant time and words to the analysis of visual culture of architecture in the form of drawings
        and images. However, of equal importance are the file formats that support the visual culture of architecture.
        These formats have their own histories and are embedded with the design intents of their authors. They reflect
        not only decisions about design software, but perhaps more importantly an understanding of the end use of the
        artifact. This is particularly relevant in the discussion of the file formats used to present design
        proposals—Image File Formats.
    </p>


    <p>When architects and designers choose an image file format for their primary means of communication, they are
        following the history of architectural drawing into what Robin Evan’s refers to as a “cul-de-sac’. Another
        possibility is to move beyond the mimesis of historical forms of representation into interactive media that
        allows continual change and dialogue between the designer and a group of potential users. This interaction
        allows for development of ideas that extend beyond the initial intents of the original designer, fostering
        engagement, collaboration, and interaction in lieu of the frozen intent of a single author.
    </p>
    <p>This semester we will move beyond the simulation of historic forms of architectural media embodied in image file
        formats. We will develop interactive drawing software to leverage the creative potential of the dialogue between
        designer and user.
